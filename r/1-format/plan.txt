Plan 

Fix metadata - add in restricted vs not

Run fish data through CheckEM





for scripts:



importinging formating and checking with plots


Hyothes:
- habitat is important (more KGW with sand)
- distance from access point (more matury KGW with greater distandce from access) 
- if comparable in habitat  - there will be more matury KGW in the restricted area


Scrip to put these covaritate together
FOV habitat
Depth
- make the distance from access point covariate
RestrictedAccess/Open

Check data with some plots!----

- Claude - please can you make some plots to check this data
 - count with a box plot by class?
-

Then make some spatial plots to check the data
use ggmaps() to graba quick make and plot spaitally
- bubble plot of each braod class and relief?


FSS GAM

- model selection
- plot importance score
= plot best model
